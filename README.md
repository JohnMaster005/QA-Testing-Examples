# QA Testing Portfolio  

Welcome to my **QA Testing Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of projects and examples that showcase my journey and skills in software testing. As I transition into a more technical role in Quality Assurance (QA), I am continuously expanding my knowledge and applying my learning to various real-world testing scenarios.  

## Professional Experience  

I worked at **Bromio**, collaborating closely with the **porting team** to ensure high-quality game releases. My responsibilities included:  

- **Test Case Creation** – Developed structured test cases covering multiple gameplay scenarios.  
- **Bug Reporting** – Identified, documented, and tracked issues to ensure proper fixes.  
- **Collaboration** – Worked alongside developers to verify bug resolutions and optimize QA workflows.  

During my time at Bromio, I contributed to the QA process for games such as **Shovel Knight Dig, Robobeat, No Umbrellas Allowed**, among others. This experience strengthened my ability to analyze, document, and report software issues effectively.  

## Why This Repository?  

I created this repository to document and demonstrate my understanding of software testing principles and practices. The projects here represent my work as I develop expertise in:  

- **Manual Testing** – Test case creation, bug reporting, and exploratory testing.  
- **QA Methodologies** – Understanding and applying best practices in software testing.  

## What’s Included?  

This repository includes a variety of QA-related examples that I’ve worked on or am currently exploring:  

### 1. Manual Testing Examples  
- **Test Case Creation**  
  I have written test cases for various web applications and websites. These include testing features such as user registration, profile updates, and more.  
  **[View Test Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nWq0zAsFL37M3CtOH-xVwpvTc2AqYpYlluocl6Bpthw/edit?usp=sharing)**  
- **Bug Reporting**  
  I’ve documented the issues found during my testing process, reporting them with severity levels, steps to reproduce, and recommendations for resolution.  

### 2. Exploratory Testing  
I’ve tested apps and websites for usability, functionality, and UI issues without predefined test scripts. This helps identify potential problems that may not be caught in formal test cases.  

### 3. QA Methodologies and Techniques  
- **Agile Testing** – Understanding how Agile methodologies impact QA testing, including writing test cases during development, continuous feedback, and sprint cycles.  
- **Test Strategy Development** – Creating test plans and strategies that align with project needs.  

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Manual Testing** – Test Case Creation, Exploratory Testing, Bug Reporting  
- **Other Tools** – Postman (for API testing), Git/GitHub for version control, and basic SQL for database queries.  

## Courses & Learning  
- **"Software Testing from Scratch: MasterClass all-in-1" (Udemy)**  
  Topics covered:  
  - Exploratory Testing  
  - Writing Effective Test Cases  
  - Bug Reporting  
  - Basic SQL for Testing  

## Future Plans  
I’m constantly learning and adding new skills to my QA toolkit. As I progress, I plan to include more examples, work on automation, and explore advanced testing practices. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to grow in the field of QA.
