# QA Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Testing Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of projects and examples that showcase my journey and skills in software testing. As I transition into a more technical role in Quality Assurance (QA), I am continuously expanding my knowledge and applying my learning to various real-world testing scenarios.

### Why This Repository?
I created this repository to document and demonstrate my understanding of the core principles and practices of software testing. The projects here represent my work as I develop expertise in manual testing, test case creation, bug reporting, and various QA methodologies.

Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight my ability to identify issues, improve software quality, and understand the testing process from start to finish. While I am still learning and refining my skills, I’m dedicated to building a strong foundation in QA.

### What’s Included?
This repository includes a variety of QA-related examples that I’ve worked on or am currently exploring:

#### 1. Manual Testing Examples
   - **Test Case Creation:**  
     I have written test cases for various web applications and websites. These include testing features such as user registration, profile updates, and more.
     **[View Test Cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nWq0zAsFL37M3CtOH-xVwpvTc2AqYpYlluocl6Bpthw/edit?usp=sharing)**  
   - **Bug Reporting:**  
     I’ve documented the issues found during my testing process, reporting them with severity levels, steps to reproduce, and recommendations for resolution.

#### 2. Exploratory Testing
   - I’ve tested apps and websites for usability, functionality, and UI issues without predefined test scripts. This helps identify potential problems that may not be caught in formal test cases.

#### 3. QA Methodologies and Techniques
   - **Agile Testing**  
     I am currently learning how Agile methodologies impact QA testing, including the importance of writing test cases during development, continuous feedback, and collaboration within sprint cycles.
   - **Test Strategy Development**  
     I’ve worked on creating test plans and strategies that align with the needs of Agile projects.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- **Manual Testing:** Test Case Creation, Exploratory Testing, Bug Reporting  
- **Other Tools:** Postman (for API testing), Git/GitHub for version control, and basic SQL for database queries.

### Courses & Learning
- **"Software Testing from Scratch: MasterClass all-in-1" (Software Testing desde cero: MasterClass todo en 1 (Udemy)**  
  Topics covered:
  - Exploratory Testing
  - Writing Effective Test Cases
  - Bug Reporting
  - Basic SQL for Testing

### Future Plans
I’m constantly learning and adding new skills to my QA toolkit. As I progress, I plan to include more examples, work on automation, and explore advanced testing practices. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to grow in the field of QA!
